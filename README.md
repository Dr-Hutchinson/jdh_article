Building an AI Research Assistant: Large Language Models as A Versatile Tool for Digital Historians

This repo contains materials for an article submission to the Journal of Digital History.

Abstract: This article explores the potential applications and implications of large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, for historical research and pedagogy. Through a series of case studies, the article utilizes historical sources to investigate LLMs' capacity for text analysis, response generation, and assistance in data preparation tasks such as oral history transcriptions and optical character recognition. GPT-4's capabilities for historical knowledge and analysis are subsequently assessed using a standard machine learning benchmark for historical knowledge, where GPT-4 achieves expert-level proficiency in three historical subfields. Given the rapid trajectory of this technology, historians should play a crucial role in the debates surrounding these technologies, as the unpredictable impacts of democratized AI are already emerging.
